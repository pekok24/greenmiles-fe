## Getting Started

First, please make sure you have Node JS, npm/yarn installed on your local machine.

You need to install all the dependencies in order the project can run on your local.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Add .env file at your root of application (can be duplicated from .env.example).

then you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
